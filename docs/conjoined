This is my idea on how to design a conjoined set of huts for MineColonies.

I prefer to build some of my huts in a group a distance away from the center
of the colony. These are generally a Citizen, Lumberjack, Miner and Guard
huts. And maybe a Deliveryman.  Perhaps, with the option to assign citizen's
to a hut, I should allow for a grouping of five huts, plus a citizen hut ...

Originally, I wanted a single build with each of those huts, but
experimentation showed that wasn't going to happen. So I started experimenting
with a minimal theme. Somewhere in there I realized I could have a build that
looked like one building, but was still a separate build for each hut, with
some decorative builds added on as needed.

So, this document was started as a dumping ground for my thoughts on this.

I think what I want is a building like this:

          +-------------+
          | Deliveryman |
+---------+-------------+---------+
| Citizen | Guard Tower | Sawmill |
+---------+-------------+---------+
          |  Miner      |
          +-------------+

or, maybe with a Fisherman hut ...

+-------------+-----------+
| Deliveryman | Sawmill   |
+-------------+-----------+
| Citizen     | Guard     |
+-------------+-----------+
| Miner       | Fisherman |
+-------------+-----------+

So maybe it would be better to make each of these interchangeable.

Each section's minimum requirement would be it's chest hut, and an extra
chest.

The Miner needs enough space for the shaft, but if I make the section
sufficiently interchangeable it can be rotated as needed.

The Citizen "needs" 5 beds at the fifth level. I think I can treat the
Citizen's hut as a collection of studio apartments.
